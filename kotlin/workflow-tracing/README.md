# workflow-tracing

This module provides a `WorkflowDiagnosticListener` called `TracingDiagnosticListener` that can be
plugged into a `WorkflowSession` to generate a Chrome-viewable tracing file. For more information
on the tracing file format, see the [`trace-encoder` README](../trace-encoder/README.md).
