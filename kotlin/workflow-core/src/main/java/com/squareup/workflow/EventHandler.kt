/**
 * Wraps a function that handles an event of type [EventT]. Implements the raw function type
 * `(EventT) -> Unit`, so instances can be invoked and passed around as functions.
 *
 * This type differs from a typical function reference in how it defines equality. All instances
 * of this class are considered equal (and have the same hashcode), which means they can be stored
 * in data classes and the event handlers will be ignored. This makes it much easier to write
 * test assertions for [Workflow] renderings that include event handlers, since you can compare
 * entire rendering types at once and not field-by-field.
