/**
 * Represents a unit of asynchronous work that can have zero, one, or multiple outputs.
 *
 * Workers allow you to execute arbitrary, possibly asynchronous tasks in a declarative manner. To
 * perform their tasks, workers return a [Flow]. Workers are effectively [Flow]s that can be
 * [compared][doesSameWorkAs] to determine equivalence between render passes. A [Workflow] uses
 * Workers to perform asynchronous work during the render pass by calling
 * [RenderContext.runningWorker].
 *
 * See the documentation on [run] for more information on the returned [Flow] is consumed and how
 * to implement asynchronous work.
 *
 * See the documentation on [doesSameWorkAs] for more details on how and when workers are compared
 * and the worker lifecycle.
 *
 * ## Example: Network request
 *
 * Let's say you have a network service with an API that returns a number, and you want to
 * call that service from a [Workflow].
 *
 * ```
 * interface TimeService {
 *   suspend fun getTime(timezone: String): Long
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The first step is to define a Worker that can call this service, and maybe an extension
 * function on your service class:
 * ```
 * fun TimeService.getTimeWorker(timezone: String): Worker<Long> = TimeWorker(timezone, this)
 *
 * private class TimeWorker(
 *   val timezone: String,
 *   val service: TimeService
 * ): Worker<Long> {
 *
 *   override fun run(): Flow<Long> = flow {
 *     val time = service.getTime(timezone)
 *     emit(time)
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You also need to define how to determine if a previous Worker is already doing the same work.
 * This will ensure that if the same request is made by the same [Workflow] in adjacent render
 * passes, we'll keep the request alive from the first pass.
 * ```
 *   override fun doesSameWorkAs(otherWorker: Worker<*>): Boolean =
 *     otherWorker is TimeWorker &&
 *       timezone == otherWorker.timezone
 * ```
 *
 * Now you can request the time from your [Workflow]:
 * ```
 * class MyWorkflow(private val timeWorker: TimeWorker) {
 *   override fun render(…): Foo {
 *     context.onWorkerOutput(timeWorker) { time -> emitOutput("The time is $time") }
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if the response is a unique type, unlikely to be shared by any other workers,
 * you don't even need to create your own Worker class, you can use a builder, and the worker
 * will automatically be distinguished by that response type:
 * ```
 * interface TimeService {
 *   fun getTime(timezone: String): Deferred<TimeResponse>
 * }
 *
 * fun TimeService.getTimeWorker(timezone: String): Worker<TimeResponse> =
 *   Worker.from { getTime(timezone).await()) }
 * ```
 *
 * @see create
 * @see from
 * @see fromNullable
 * @see Deferred.asWorker
 * @see BroadcastChannel.asWorker
 */
interface Worker<out OutputT> {

  /**
   * Returns a [Flow] to execute the work represented by this worker.
   *
   * [Flow] is "a cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes
   * normally or with an exception", although it may not emit any values. It is common to use
   * workers to perform some side effect that should only be executed when a state is entered – in
   * this case, the worker never emits anything (and will have type `Worker<Nothing>`).
   *
   * ## Coroutine Context
   *
   * When a worker is started, a coroutine is launched to [collect][Flow.collect] the flow.
   * When the worker is torn down, the coroutine is cancelled.
   * This coroutine is launched in the same scope as the workflow runtime, with a few changes:
   *
   * - The dispatcher is always set to [Unconfined][kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers.Unconfined] to
   *   minimize overhead for workers that don't care which thread they're executed on (e.g. logging
   *   side effects, workers that wrap third-party reactive libraries, etc.). If your work cares
   *   which thread it runs on, use [withContext][kotlinx.coroutines.withContext] or
   *   [flowOn][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.flowOn] to specify a dispatcher.
   * - A [CoroutineName][kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineName] that describes the `Worker` instance
   *   (via `toString`) and the key specified by the workflow running the worker.
   *
   * ## Exceptions
   *
   * If a worker needs to report an error to the workflow running it, it *must not* throw it as an
   * exception – any exceptions thrown by a worker's [Flow] will cancel the entire workflow runtime.
   * Instead, the worker's [OutputT] type should be capable of expressing errors itself, and the
   * worker's logic should wrap any relevant exceptions into an output value (e.g. using the
   * [catch][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.catch] operator).
   *
   * While this might seem restrictive, this design decision keeps the [RenderContext.runningWorker]
   * API simpler, since it does not need to handle exceptions itself. It also discourages the code
   * smell of relying on exceptions to handle control flow.
   */

  /**
   * Override this method to define equivalence between [Worker]s.
   *
   * At the end of every render pass, the set of [Worker]s that were requested by the workflow are
   * compared to the set from the last render pass using this method. Equivalent workers are allowed
   * to keep running. New workers are started ([run] is called and the returned [Flow] is
   * collected). Old workers are cancelled by cancelling their collecting coroutines.
   *
   * Implementations of this method should not be based on object identity. For example, a [Worker]
   * that performs a network request might check that two workers are requests to the same endpoint
   * and have the same request data.
   *
   * Most implementations of this method will check for concrete type equality, and then match
   * on constructor parameters.
