/**
 * Defines a discrete task that a [Workflow] can execute asynchronously via [WorkflowPool],
 * possibly across state changes.
 *
 * ## Defining Workers
 *
 * There are a few ways to define a worker:
 *  - Call [worker] and pass a suspending block:
 *    ```
 *    val echoWorker = worker { input ->
 *      withContext(IO) {
 *        echoService.echo(input)
 *      }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 *  - Convert a [Deferred] to a worker directly:
 *    ```
 *    val deferredWorker = deferred.asWorker()
 *    ```
 *
 *  - Implement the `Worker` interface and implement [call]:
 *    ```
 *    class EchoWorker(
 *      private val echoService: EchoService,
 *      private val ioContext: CoroutineContext
 *    ) : Worker<String, String> {
 *      override suspend fun call(input: String): String =
 *        withContext(ioContext) {
 *          echoService.echo(input)
 *        }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * ## Running Workers
 *
 * To use, pass an instance of your [Worker] to [WorkflowPool.awaitWorkerResult] along with its
 * input value. You may also pass an optional `name` `String` if you need to distinguish between
 * multiple invocations. E.g.:
 *
 * ```
 * class MainReactor(private val echo: EchoWorker) : Reactor<…> {
 *   override suspend fun onReact(
 *     …,
 *     workflows: WorkflowPool
 *   ): Reaction<…, …> {
 *     …
 *     workflows.awaitWorkerResult(echo, "hello world")
 *       .let { result: String ->
 *         // React to result.
 *       }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Note on Dispatchers
 *
 * Workers are always invoked with the
 * [Unconfined][kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers.Unconfined] dispatcher. If a worker
 * needs a specific dispatcher (e.g. to do IO), it should use
 * [withContext][kotlinx.coroutines.withContext].
