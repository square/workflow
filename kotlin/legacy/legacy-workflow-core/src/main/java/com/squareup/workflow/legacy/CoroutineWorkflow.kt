/**
 * Starts a coroutine in the given [context] that runs [block] to produce states and the result
 * for the returned [Workflow].
 *
 * The block gets a [SendChannel] that it can use to emit [states][S], and a [ReceiveChannel] that
 * it can use to receive [events][E] from the workflow's [WorkflowInput]. The block's return value
 * is used as the workflow's result.
 * The state channel is a
 * [ConflatedBroadcastChannel][kotlinx.coroutines.channels.ConflatedBroadcastChannel],
 * which means that sends will never suspend or fail, and if observers of the workflow aren't
 * receiving fast enough, they will miss intermediate states.
 * The event channel has [unlimited capacity][UNLIMITED].
