/**
 * Helper for [Reactor]s that can accept events from external sources.
 *
 * From inside `onReact`, you can handle events by calling `select` and passing a block that describes
 * how to handle each event type you're willing to accept. A [Single] will be returned that will
 * complete as soon as a matching event (or other clause, see below) is selected. Any exceptions
 * thrown from within your event handler blocks, or the `select` block itself, will be reported
 * through that `Single`.
 *
 * For example,
 * ```
 * events.select {
 *   onEvent<ButtonClicked> { EnterState(ButtonHasBeenClicked) }
 *   onEvent<BackPressed> { FinishWith(Canceled) }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also simultaneously wait for [Single]s to complete by calling `onSuccess` alongside your
 * `onEvent`s.
 *
 * When you specify at least one `onEvent` clause, if the next event sent down the channel doesn't
 * match any of your clauses, the `Single` will complete with an [IllegalStateException].
 *
 * If, at the time an event is sent, the reactor is not actively listening for events, the
 * event will be queued up and delivered as soon as the reactor asks for the next event.
 * Note that when the reactor _does_ get around to processing the next event, if it doesn't match
 * any of its cases, it will still throw. Events are not re-ordered or re-enqueued to try to find a
 * matching event.
 *
 * @param E The supertype of all valid events. Probably a sealed class.

   * Returns a [Single] that will complete successfully when [Workflow.sendEvent] is passed an
   * event that matches one of the select cases specified by the given block.
   *
   * Exceptions thrown from `block` are thrown immediately, exceptions thrown from select cases are
   * emitted by the returned `Single`.
   *
   * This method will throw if called multiple times before either:
   * 1. an acceptable event is sent.
   * 2. the returned `Single` is unsubscribed from. This allows you to compose the resulting single
   *    with other `Single`s that will preempt our emitting (e.g. timing out waiting for an event).
   *
   * If the workflow is abandoned while waiting for an event, the single will never complete. It will
   * be unsubscribed from immediately instead.
