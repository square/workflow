 * Implemented by objects that want the option to intercept back button taps.
 * Can be implemented by [View] subclasses, or can be attached to a stock view via
 * [Helper.setBackHandler].
 *
 * When implemented by a container view, the [onBackPressed] methods or tags of its
 * subviews should be invoked first, via [Helper.onBackPressed]
 *
 * To kick things off, override [android.app.Activity.onBackPressed] to call
 * [WorkflowActivityRunner.onBackPressed] or [WorkflowFragment.onBackPressed]
 *
 * **NB** This is all expected to be scrapped as soon as
 * [OnBackPressedDispatcher](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/activity/OnBackPressedDispatcher.html)
 * stabilizes.
