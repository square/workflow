# Using a workflow to show UI


## `ContainerViewController`

In the Workflow architecture, the container acts as the glue between the state-driven world of Workflows and the UI that is ultimately displayed. On iOS, the container is implemented as `ContainerViewController`.

```swift

/// Binds a root workflow to a renderable view controller.
public final class ContainerViewController<Output>: UIViewController {

    /// Emits output events from the bound workflow.
    public let output: Signal<Output, NoError>

    public init<WorkflowType>(workflow: WorkflowType, viewRegistry: ViewRegistry) where WorkflowType: Workflow, WorkflowType.Output == Output

}

```

The first initializer argument is the workflow that will drive your application.

The second initializer argument is the view registry. The view registry acts as a mapping between the view models (`Screen`s) that your workflow emits and the concrete UI implementations that should be used to display them.

```swift
import UIKit
import Workflow
import WorkflowUI

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        let window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)

        var viewRegistry = ViewRegistry()

        let container = ContainerViewController(
            workflow: DemoWorkflow(),
            viewRegistry: viewRegistry)

        window.rootViewController = container
        self.window = window
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
}

```

Your project should compile at this point. It will crash as soon as the workflow emits a screen, however, because we have not registered any UI implementations with the view registry. Let's fix that:

```swift
let workflow: Workflow<Screen, Never> = /// Instantiate a workflow

var viewRegistry = ViewRegistry()

viewRegistry.register(screenViewControllerType: DemoScreenViewController.self)

let container = ContainerViewController(
    workflow: DemoWorkflow(),
    viewRegistry: viewRegistry)
```
