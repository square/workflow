# Swift

The Workflow infrastructure is split into several modules.

### `Workflow`

The `Workflow` library contains the core types that are used to implement state-driven workflows, including the `Workflow` protocol and related indrastructure.

### `WorkflowUI`

Contains the basic infrastructure required to build a Workflow-based application that uses `UIKit`.

Workflow for iOS makes extensive use of [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift). If you are new to reactive programming, you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the basics. Workflow takes care of a lot of the reactive plumbing in a typical application, but you will have a better time if you understand what the framework is doing.
