/**
 * Implements a state machine where the states are represented by objects of type (or subclasses of
 * type) `S`.
 *
 * > ***Using [CoroutineReactor] directly is not currently supported. Subclass `Reactor` instead.***
 *
 * The state machine can be initialized with an arbitrary value of type `I` which is converted to
 * the initial state by the method [onStart].
 *
 * When the state machine is executed, each consecutive state will be passed to [onReact], which
 * returns a [Reaction] indicating what to do next:
 *   * `EnterState(nextState)`: Call [onReact] again with `nextState`.
 *   * `FinishWith(result)`: The state machine is in a terminal state and has a result of type `O`.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * private val onFoo = Channel<Unit>()
 * private val onBar = Channel<Unit>()
 *
 * private fun handleFoo(): Reaction<…> { … }
 *
 * fun onFooClicked() = onFoo.send(Unit)
 *
 * override suspend fun onReact(state: MyState): Reaction<…> = when(state) {
 *   JustFooState -> select {
 *     onFoo.onReceive { handleFoo() }
 *   }
 *
 *   FooOrBarState -> select {
 *     onFoo.onReceive { handleFoo() }
 *     onBar.onReceive { EnterState(JustFooState) }
 *   }
 *
 *   BarStateAsync -> select {
 *     onBar.onReceive { async { EnterState(JustFooState) }.await() }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you need to perform asynchronous work to handle an event,
 * ```
 * private val onFoo = Channel<Unit>()
 * private val onBar = Channel<Unit>()
 *
 * private suspend fun handleFooAsync(): Reaction<…> { … }
 *
 * override suspend fun onReact(state: MyState): Reaction<…> = when(state) {
 *   JustFooState -> select {
 *     onFoo.onReceive { handleFooAsync() }
 *   }
 *
 *   FooOrBarState -> select {
 *     onFoo.onReceive { handleFooAsync() }
 *     onBar.onReceive { EnterState(JustFooState) }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If, like the above example, all of your states handle events, you can pull the [select]
 * call up:
 * ```
 * override suspend fun onReact(state: MyState): Reaction<…> = select {
 *   when(state) {
 *     JustFooState -> onFoo.onReceive { handleFoo() }
 *
 *     FooOrBarState -> {
 *       onFoo.onReceive { handleFoo() }
 *       onBar.onReceive { EnterState(JustFooState) }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For more information, including a how-to guide for writing Reactors, please see the `README.md` file
 * in this package.
 *
 * @param S State type
 * @param E Event type. If your Reactor doesn't have any events, use `Nothing`
 * @param O Output (result) type
